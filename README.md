# Tensor Differential

This was a project for school in 2023 where the goal was to reimplement part of the Tensor class from PyTorch.

## Desc

In this repository are included:
  - The Tensor Class: [src/Tensor.py](src/Tensor.py)
  - Dual functions: [src/functions.py](src/functions.py)
  - Tensor Unit Tests: [unit_tests.py](unit_tests.py)
  - Functional Tests: [functional_tests.py](functional_tests.py)

## Run the Tests

- Download the librairies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the unit tests: pytest -v unit_tests.py
- Run the functional tests: pytest -v functional_tests.py
